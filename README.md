# Motor Controller  
## Topic  
Design a speed and rotation direction control system for DC motor using feedback encoder and PIC16F877A microcontroller    
## Description  
- There are 5 buttons:  
    - Start
    - Stop
    - Forward: speed is displayed on the LCD by positive value
    - Reverse: speed is displayed on the LCD by negative value
    - ADC (by variable resistor): change the speed of motor
- When pressing a button, the speed returns to 0 and then operates
